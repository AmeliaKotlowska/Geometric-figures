# Geometric-figures
Create an abstract class Shape with two methods getArea and getPerimeter. Create classes that inherit from Shape, such as Square, Triangle, Circle, and Rectangle. The getArea and getPerimeter methods should reflect the actual formulas for the area and perimeter of a specific geometric figure. Write tests for the provided solution.
